# Travelist

A smart travel packing app that generates a packing list based on your destination, dates and and activities. It then allows you to sign up and save multiple trips as part of a user profile. On a profile, a user will be able to see a photo of their destination, a countdown to their trip, a progress bar to track their packing, and the high level weather forecast for their trip.

Optimised for both mobile and desktop.
